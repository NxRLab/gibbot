The content in this folder corresponds to Matlab code written
for simulating a two-link, single joint brachiating/walking robot.  The 
code is not well documented, but the structure should become clear after 
enough digging around.  The main functions are called in test.m.  Other
initial conditions can be found in solutions.m.  Before running any code,
please make sure to run mbinit.m.

mb = monkey bot
md = monkey derivative (central differencing)
mm = monkey map (gaits over time)
mp = monkey plotter
