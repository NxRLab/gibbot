/// Gives the commutation functions for driving the BLDC motor.
/** @file 
 * The commutate function uses the High, Low and Float functions to commutate
 * the motor. The input to the function is the motor state from the hall effect 
 * sensors. Depending on the value of the global variable "direction" the
 * function sets the motor outputs according to the motor's commutation pattern.
 * The commutation pattern is derived from the commutation diagram found on p32
 * of Maxon's E-Paper Catalog and is shown below.
 *
 * Hall Sen 321 | 101 | 001 | 011 | 010 | 110 | 100 |
 * -------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
 *     State    |  5  |  1  |  3  |  2  |  6  |  4  |
 * 1 -   Red    |  +  |  +  |  0  |  -  |  -  |  0  |
 * 2 -  Black   |  -  |  0  |  +  |  +  |  0  |  -  |
 * 3 -  White   |  0  |  -  |  -  |  0  |  +  |  +  |
 *
 * An input of 0 to the commutate function will turn off the motor.
 * The PWM module runs at #PWM_FREQ_50_KHZ in
 * complementary mode to work with the HIP4086 BLDC driver.
 * In complementary mode each of the three PWM modules controls two outputs
 * whose states are the inverse of each other.
 * The module incorporates a dead time delay between the falling edge of one
 * signal and the rising edge of the next to prevent shoot through.

    OVRDAT0.  The assumption is that all other bits never change.
    
    These other bits are set so that they 

    - enable PWM on output pins tied to PWMxH & PWMxL 
    - sets the polarity of PWMxH (POLH) to active low (i.e., ON = 0)
    - all other registers are at their default states.

    In particular, complementary output mode is a default setting at startup.
    
    @note The PWMxH pin is set to active low to satisfy the input requirement
    for the HIP4086 BLDC H-bridge driver.  The H-bridge is also the reason PWMxH
    and PWMxL need to be in complementary mode.
