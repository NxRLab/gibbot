TO DO List:

---- Right now the parsing of the messages from the PIC is very
   "dumb."  I just look for the total number of characters to be
   correct.  I should fix this.

---- Clean up the structure of the code a bit, there are a few pretty
   long functions

---- Investigate the use of the io Python package to provide more code
   portability.  With this package, we can make EOLs and tabs
   standard across all OS's.

---- Investigate the "bytearray" datatype available in Python 2.6+.  I
   believe I can get rid of a lot of &0xFF statments by using it.

---- [DONE] Remember last set of arguments used/ load any file with arguments
   saved in it

---- [DONE] Add a -x option for mplabx directory structure/ figure out how to
   call script from mplabx

---- [DONE] Add sample usage to help listings

---- [DONE] Add a switch for listing ports and exiting

---- [DONE] Figure out why the Windows machines require an extra delay
   after sending a message.

---- [DONE] Add arg to reset the PIC into run mode
