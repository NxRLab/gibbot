The two directories contain the PIC code to run the Gibbot using open-loop control and the python bootloader script.  The bootloader is a python script, which MPLAB X calls as part of its build routine to automatically program the PIC after a program is done compiling.  When using Cygwin, as the build option in MPLAB X does, please keep in mind that the serial port number is one less than the Windows COM port.  For example COM8 is really ttyS7 under Cygwin.
